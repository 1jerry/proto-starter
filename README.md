# proto-starter
An isomorphic (universal) web app starter project. This project is designed with developer productivity and happiness in mind.
This is because it uses Viewmodel for declarative components and state management. Viewmodel is easy-to-use and powerful, and fallback on React if needed.
This starter has SSR, isomorphic routing built-in.
It is also highly extendable using Meteor's capabilities
It doesn't rely on many dependancies but can already do a lot.

Technology used
-------------
1. [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for isomorphic builds, SSR, easy code splitting (dynamic imports), reactive data, user accounts...
2. [Viewmodel](https://viewmodel.org/) For components, state management, validation, bindings between state and view... 
3. [React] (https://facebook.github.io/react/) For the underlying layer of Viewmodel. It can be changed to [Inferno](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno) according to Viewmodel, and this would imply some changes in this starter.
4. [Universal router] (https://github.com/kriasoft/universal-router) and [History](https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/) to provide an easy-to-use, isomorphic router.
5. Test suite for Viewmodel and React: enzyme, jest... See [Viewmodel](https://viewmodel.org/) documentation for testing
6. [Debugging tool for Viewmodel](https://medium.com/@manueldeleon_94284/viewmodel-explorer-a-debugging-tool-3833403c3821): viewmodel-react-explorer component is included in the <App /> component, and let you play with the states of components
